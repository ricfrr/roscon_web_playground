# Community Events

## Birds of a Feather

ROSCon XX 20XX will include space for birds of a feather (BoF) sessions.
These sessions are community organized spaces for like minded individuals to gather in a spot to discuss a common interest, organize an outing, or demonstrate a technology. 


## Lightning Talks 


On the first full day of ROSCon XX through the morning coffee break (~11:10 AM) we will provide a form to submit your name, talk title, and optionally slides or a video for your lightning talk.
Slides are not required, and there are no particular format requirements other than a **six slide maximum**.
If you choose to use slides or video they must work on the coordinator's laptop.
We recommend you use common portable formats (e.g. PDF).
Videos are also acceptable but they must be *less than two minutes, and preferably less than ninety seconds*.
We cannot guarantee the audio from your video will work correctly.
Videos not hosted on Vimeo or Youtube must be less than 100MB in size.
Given our time constraints, we would recommend against trying to do a live demo.
_If your lightning talk violates any of the constraints listed above it will be removed from the lottery_. 

Lightning talks will be reviewed and then selected via a lottery.
Approximately after lunch on the first day of ROSCon XX the selected lightning talks will be announced on the ROSCon XX website and via e-mail. 

Finally, and we can not stress this enough, KEEPüëèITüëèSHORTüëè.
You will have exactly two minutes and a maximum of six slides.
We recommend the following format:

* Who you are
* What you're working on
* Your cool thing / idea / project
* Where to find more information (we suggest using a link shortener / QR code)
* Make it fun!
* KEEP IT SHORT
